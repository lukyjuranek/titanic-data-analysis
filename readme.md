# Titanic Data Analysis
This project involves data analysis of the Titanic disaster dataset using various machine learning models.
## Project Structure
The project consists of three main R scripts:

`main.R`: This is the main script that runs the machine learning models. It calls functions from ML-model.R and generates plots using plots.R.

`ml_utilities.R`: This script contains three machine learning models - decision tree, random forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). It also includes all the functions needed to run these models.

`final_model.R`: This script contains the final model that was used to predict the survival of passengers in the test dataset.

`plots.R`: This script contains all the plots that were used mainly in the first part of the analysis.
