# Titanic Data Analysis
This project involves data analysis of the Titanic disaster dataset using various machine learning models.
## Project Structure
The project consists of three main R scripts:
`main.R`: This is the main script that runs the machine learning models. It calls functions from ML-model.R and generates plots using plots.R.
`ML-model.R`: This script contains three machine learning models - decision tree, random forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). It also includes all the functions needed to run these models.
`plots.R`: This script contains all the plots that were used mainly in the first part of the analysis.
